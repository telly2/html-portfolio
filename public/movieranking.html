 <h1>The Best Movies According to Shantel</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Corrina Corrina</h3>
 <p>I just love how Corrina loved on Molly, and doing so helped to fix her broken heart</p>
 <h3>Dirty dancing</h3>
 <p>It's really just a timeless love story that really played on my hopeless romantic side</p>
 <h3>Oh My Venus</h3>
 <p>I love that she gets her confidence back, and it ends with her being big again but confident this time.</p>
